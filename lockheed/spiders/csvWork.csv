As an embedded software engineer, you draw on a culture of innovation, famed for a long heritage of accomplishments. Equally important, you’ll have the training and education resources as well as leadership that can guide you in creating real-life, proven innovations. In fact, often our advanced technologies become products and services that the entire world depends upon. And as you build the software for these advances, you’ll also have the opportunity to take your career to new heights.<br><br>Develop and maintain embedded software applications and/or desktop applications for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) products. Typical applications are software products related to image processing, target detection and tracking, guidance/ navigation/ control algorithms, system control, built-in test, and system communication. Algorithm proficiency is required. Tasks will include development of code for both embedded hardware and simulations as a part of full system integration. Tasks will include algorithm development and implementation, specification and generation of telemetry and development of evaluation tools such as GUI applications and telemetry display tools. Hands on lab integration and testing including Software-in-the-loop and Hardware-in-the-loop development and testing. Development will be in C, C++, C#, and/or Ada. <br><br>So forge a new path for technology that serves humanity. Become an embedded software engineer at Lockheed Martin. You are meant to solve the hardest challenges.<br><br>Relocation:  Relocation assistance is possible for this exciting position.  <br>The Locale: Orlando is a city in the Central Florida area.
